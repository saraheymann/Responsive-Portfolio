		<p class="bio">I'm an installation artist, set designer, painter and teacher.  I'm from Riverwoods, IL, and received my BFA from Pratt Institute.  I'm currently based in Chicago, IL.<br><br> I'm going to write a bit more on here to fill up space.  I'm trying to make this section work, but I'm not quite sure what to say ! Oh my, so....I guess I have to write even more.  Well, hmm, what can I say...I think I'll probably change all of the pictures on here some time- but maybe not right now.

		This is my portfolio, check it out.
